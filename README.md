## About

The **CPP Module** project is part of the curriculum at [42 São Paulo](https://www.42sp.org.br/). This project aims to deepen the understanding of C++ programming by exploring advanced concepts and features of the language, such as object-oriented programming, templates, exception handling, and more.

## Modules

This project is divided into several modules, each focusing on different aspects of C++:

- **[Module00](module00)**: Basics of C++ (namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and more);
- **[Module01](module01)**: Memory Allocation (new, delete, pointers to members, references, file streams);
- **[Module02](module02)**: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overloading;
- **[Module03](module03)**: Inheritance;
- **[Module04](module04)**: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces;
- **[Module05](module05)**: Repetition and Exceptions;
- **[Module06](module06)**: C++ Casts;
- **[Module07](module07)**: Templates;
- **[Module08](module08)**: Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms;
- **Module09**: Repetition and Containers.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler supporting C++98 standard.
- Make utility for building the project.

## How to Compile

Each module comes with a Makefile to ease the compilation process. Navigate to the module directory and run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
make
```

This will compile the project and generate the executable file.

To clean up the object files generated during compilation:

```sh
make clean
```

To clean all generated files, including the executable:

```sh
make fclean
```

To recompile the project from scratch:

```sh
make re
```

## How to Use

After compiling the project, run the generated executable from the terminal:

```sh
./module_executable
```

or you can run with valgrind using:

```sh
make run
```

Each module may have specific instructions on how to use and test the features implemented. Refer to the module's README or documentation for detailed usage.

## File Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:
